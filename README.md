## 💡 Tips for Optimal Performance

- **Initial Capital**: Ensure your wallet is funded with at least **3 SOL** to start observing meaningful profits.
- **Diversified Arbitrage**: The bot actively scans **Solana**, **Raydium**, and **Orca** DEXs to identify the best price differences for swapping SOL, optimizing your potential gains.
- **Testing**: If you're new to arbitrage trading, consider testing the bot with smaller amounts until you're comfortable with its operations.

## 🤖 How the Bot Works

The **Solana Arbitrage Bot** continuously monitors price discrepancies across multiple DEXs on the Solana network. When it detects a profitable arbitrage opportunity, the bot swaps SOL between these platforms to capitalize on the price differences, executing the trades automatically for you.

- **Efficiency**: The bot works in real-time, ensuring that you never miss an opportunity.
- **Smart Execution**: It selects the best trading paths between platforms to maximize profit.

## ⚠️ Important Considerations

- **Funded Wallet**: Ensure your wallet has **at least 3 SOL** available to initiate trades. Insufficient funds will prevent the bot from performing arbitrage operations.
- **Competitive Nature**: Arbitrage opportunities are often fleeting and competitive. While the bot is designed to find and execute profitable trades quickly, returns are not guaranteed. Strategic funding and active monitoring will enhance your results.
